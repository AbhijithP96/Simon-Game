    <h3>How To Play</h3>
    <p>In this interactive game, the player engages by triggering a tile to blink, accompanied by an associated sound when they press a key on their keyboard.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, the player is tasked with the challenge of selecting the correct tile in response.</p>
    <p>As the game progresses, a new tile is introduced into the sequence, requiring the player to memorize and replicate the entire sequence accurately.</p>
    <p>To successfully navigate the game, the player must recall and select the tiles from the initial sequence in the correct order.</p>
    <p>This game not only tests memory and reaction time but also offers an engaging and immersive experience for players looking for a mental challenge and entertainment.</p>
